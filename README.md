# This demo document is designed for the business people, software developers, and executable stakeholders to understand the standard operating process (SOP).

## 0101. User Management
### Overview
This section is responsible for creating and managing users, groups and roles. It ensures the authentication and authorization of users from different locations. It includes 
1.	User: Each user is assigned a unique identity within the context. By creating a user entity, it is ensured.
2.	User Group: To make it easier to administer a large number of users, users can be organized into named groups. Groups can in turn be assigned membership in other groups. 
3.	Authorization : After creating a user, S/he needs some permission to use the system. Each process (menu) has some action (add, edit, view, delete, etc.) that we call authorization events. This event must be permissible for authorized and responsible users. This section is to assign all kinds of authorization. 
4.	Authorization Role: Like “user group” Authorization can be grouped based on common user responsibility and assigned to user so that S/he can get a set of authorization permission.
5.	Location binding: If an organization wants the user to use the system from a definite location, the user can be assigned for specific or multiple locations from where S/he can continue his/her official operation.

### Business Constraints
1.	Single user can be assigned an authorization or authorization role so that S/he can get permissible for a set of authorization at a glance.
2.	The User Group can be assigned an Authorization role or single authorization.
